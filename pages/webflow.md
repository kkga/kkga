[Webflow](https://webflow.com) is a "no-code" web platform.

This is a collection of various projects I worked on in the last few years.

## Symbol Overrides, 2019

As a first step in a much larger plan for symbols, Override Fields let authors create parametric symbols where any content property can be overriden on an instance.
