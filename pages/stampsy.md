## Stampsy web, 2014

Worked as a designer (and partly as a front-end engineer) at Stampsy â€” a web platform for sharing and discovering visual stories. I designed the product and built a modular CSS architecture behind it.

## Stampsy iPad app, 2012

In 2012, before becoming a web platform, Stampsy was an experimental iPad app for creating stories with a simple design editor. I designed and prototyped a lot of its touch-based interactions with different tools and codez.
