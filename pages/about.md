My name is Gadzhi Kharkharov. I was born in [Dagestan](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan), but currently living in Moscow.

Designing software is what I do for work and joy.

### Currently

I currently work at [Webflow](https://webflow.com) -- a tool that makes producing for web more approachable. Mostly trying to figure out how to create the right visual tools for designers.

### Previously

Worked as a designer (and partly as a front-end engineer) at [Stampsy](https://stampsy.com) -- a web platform for sharing and discovering visual stories. I designed the product and built a modular CSS architecture behind it.

### Game design

Recently I became interested in video [game design and development](/tags/gamedev). It's a fun area that is hard to master and I try to spend my free time tinkering with various personal projects. I have a [dlog](/tags/dlog) where I sometime post (very rough) updates on this journey.

I also enjoy reading about game design theory and practice. Here's a collection of my favorite [game design books and resources](/notes/gamedesign-resources).
