My name is Gadzhi Kharkharov. I was born in
[Dagestan](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan), but currently living in Moscow.

Designing software is what I do for work and joy.

### Work

#### Webflow (2015--2021)

Worked at [Webflow](https://webflow.com) -- a tool that makes producing for web
more approachable. Mostly focused on figuring out how to create the right visual
tools for designers.<br/> **[Learn more about my work at Webflow ->](/webflow)**

#### Stampsy (2012--2014)

Worked as a designer (and partly as a front-end engineer) at
[Stampsy](https://stampsy.com) -- a web platform for sharing and discovering
visual stories. I designed the product and built a modular CSS architecture
behind it.<br/> **[Learn more about my work Stampsy ->](/stampsy)**

### Game design

Recently I became interested in video
[game design and development](/tags/gamedev). It's a fun area that is hard to
master and I try to spend my free time tinkering with various personal projects.
I have a [dlog](/tags/dlog) where I sometime post (very rough) updates on this
journey.

I also enjoy reading about game design theory and practice. Here's a collection
of my favorite [game design books and resources](/notes/gamedesign-resources).
