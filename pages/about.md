Designing software is what I do for work and joy.

## Work

#### Webflow (2015--2021)

Worked at [Webflow](https://webflow.com) -- a platform that makes producing for
web more approachable. Mostly focused on figuring out how to create the right
visual tools for designers.<br/>

#### Stampsy (2012--2014)

Worked as a designer (and partly as a front-end engineer) at
[Stampsy](https://stampsy.com) -- a small web platform for creating and
discovering visual stories. I designed the product and built a modular CSS
architecture behind it.<br/> **[Learn more about my work Stampsy →](/stampsy)**

## Game design

Recently I became interested in video game design and development. It's a fun
area that is hard to master and I try to spend my free time tinkering with
various personal projects. I have a [dlog](/tags/dlog) where I sometimes post
(very rough) updates on this journey.

I also enjoy reading about game design theory and practice. Here's a collection
of my favorite [game design books and resources](/notes/gamedesign-resources).

## Programming

When it comes to programming, I'm a master of none. Tinkering with code has been
a big part of my life for as long as I remember and it still brings me joy and
makes time pass faster.

Whether it's making design prototypes with JavaScript at work, making games with
Godot or Unity, writing shell scripts for my
[Linux desktop](https://github.com/kkga/dotfiles) or making little CLI apps with
Go, I love it all and always try to learn more. I put occasionally useful things
on [my GitHub](https://github.com/kkga).
