### Work

#### Webflow (2015--2021)

Worked at [Webflow](https://webflow.com) -- a platform that makes producing for
web more approachable. Mostly focused on figuring out how to create the right
visual tools for designers.<br/>

#### Stampsy (2012--2014)

Worked as a designer (and partly as a front-end engineer) at
[Stampsy](https://stampsy.com) -- a small web platform for creating and
discovering visual stories. I designed the product and built a modular CSS
architecture behind it.<br/> **[Learn more about my work Stampsy ->](/stampsy)**

### Game design

Recently I became interested in video game design and development. It's a fun
area that is hard to master and I try to spend my free time tinkering with
various personal projects. I have a [dlog](/tags/dlog) where I sometimes post
(very rough) updates on this journey.

I also enjoy reading about game design theory and practice. Here's a collection
of my favorite [game design books and resources](/notes/gamedesign-resources).
