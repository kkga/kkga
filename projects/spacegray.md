# Spacegray

Sublime Text is an excellent text editor. While it looks great out of the box
today, this wasn't the case when it just appeared several years ago.

Spacegray was one of the first custom UI themes for it and became quite popular:
it's been installed by ~400k users and has ~7k stars on GitHub.
