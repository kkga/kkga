**Gadzhi** — I'm a software designer based in İstanbul. Currently, I work at
[Retool](https://retool.com) as a design engineer. Prior to that, I was an early
designer at [Webflow](https://webflow.com). You can learn more
[about me](about.md) and [my work](work.md).

In my free time, I enjoy working on small personal [projects](projects),
learning new things, and playing challenging video games (particularly those by
From Software).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@kkga_) or reach out via email
