**Hi, I'm Gadzhi.** Software designer based in İstanbul, Türkiye.

I work at [Retool](https://retool.com) during the day as a design engineer.
Before that I was an early designer at [Webflow](https://webflow.com). Read more
[about me](about.md) and [my work](work.md).

Outside of work, I like tinkering with small [personal projects](projects),
learning new things or playing hard video games (mainly by From Software).

Lastly, you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/@kkga_) or reach out
over email: it's x-at-kkga-dot-me.
