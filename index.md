### Hi, I'm Gadzhi

Software designer based in ~Moscow, Russia~ İstanbul, Türkiye.

I work at [Retool](https://retool.com) during the day as a design engineer.
Before that I worked at [Webflow](https://webflow.com). You can
[read more about my professional work](work.md).

Outside of work, I like tinkering with small [personal projects](projects),
learning new things or playing hard video games (mainly by From Software).
