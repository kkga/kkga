**Gadzhi** --- I'm a software designer based in İstanbul, Türkiye.

I work at [Retool](https://retool.com) as a design engineer during the day.
Before that, I was an early designer at [Webflow](https://webflow.com). You can
find out more [about me](about.md) and [my work](work.md).

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with small personal [projects](projects),
learning new things or playing hard video games (particularly those by From
Software).

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/@kkga_) or reach out via email
at x-at-kkga.me.
