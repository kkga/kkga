## What is creativity?

- Collisions of elements typically not associated with one another
- Crossing of contexts, moving things into new infrastructure
- Making the familiar unfamiliar
- ::Almost never “the creation of something truly new”.::

## Hierarchy in games

- a unique rule construct changes presentation and content and turns into a
  genre
- vast majority of work is done within genres, with simple variants at best
- creating of new games is vanishingly rare in videogames - tabletop on the
  other hand, does it frequently

## Atomization and abstraction

- Look for core small bits - Games are made of smaller games
- Break down and compartmentalise the game - Treat each input as a game, each
  subsystem as a game - Once you think modularly, you can replace modules at
  will
- Build your mechanics library - Going back to simple games (80s classics,
  mobile, etc) is the best way
- Distance yourself from the core problem - Find ways to reframe your simulation
  problem in fresh language
- learn to see things abstractedly: distill the aesthetics into actual small
  mechanics

## Context replacement

- creativity isn’t about ex nihilo creation
- it’s about moving known bricks around and connecting them in unexpected ways -
  remember, if games are made of games, even the tiny thing is a possible brick
- ::the biggest tool for doing this is pushing your known brick dramatically out
  of context:: - example: a dice is always thought of as a _probability_ device,
  but it can be: a token with hit points, countdown device, indicator of state,
  indicator of max value, brick you build with

## Add a statistic

- simplest means of innovation
- new stat implies a new rule, which means at minimum you’ve created a new
  variant
- time to complete: possible time attack mode
- number of moves: possible efficiency subgame
- attack strength rating: possible divergent strategies
- each time you add a stat, try removing an existing one

## Work in the materials

- the tools of game systems are math relationships
- think analog, not digital
- working analog for digital concepts forces context switching
- “could I stick a hex-grid under an FPS?”
- make things that are known very well unfamiliar to you again

## Force constraints

- specific types of pieces prompt a mechanic
- doing level design? Try abstracting your level into a graph
- give yourself an impossible limit and you’ll start inventing new mechanics

## Add a verb or a goal

- take a platfromer, add “fast” — you get speedruns
- the most interesting gameplay comes when the player’s goals are somehow
  contradictory

## Change input mappings

- swap an analog input for a binary one
- swap simple input for a complex one
- swap an instant action for a timed one
