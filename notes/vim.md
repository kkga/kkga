If I had to choose one single piece of software, I'd choose
[Vim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>).

I've only been a Vim user for a couple years, but I think I'm going to use it
(or some future reincarnation of it) for the rest of my life. It takes a while
to form this relationship, but once you get past the initial frustration and
start [speaking its language][grok-vi] -- nothing else can transfer your
thoughts into the computer as efficiently and effortlessly.

## Getting comfortable with Vim

Assuming youâ€™re on a Unix-like operating system, you likely have a great Vim
learning tool in the command line ready. Open the terminal and type:

    $ vimtutor

Work through it, more than once. This is what has been the most effective for
me.

After getting through the initial valley of despair, start sculpting [your own
.vimrc][vimrc].

If you're more of a video tutorial person, thoughtbot has a nice consise course
[here][thoughtbot].
