I designed the product and built a modular CSS\narchitecture behind it.<br/>\n**[Learn more about my work Stampsy →](/work/stampsy)**\n\n## Game design\n\nI got interested in video game design and development. It's a fun area that is\nhard to master and I try to spend my free time tinkering with various personal\nprojects. I have a [dlog](/dlog) where I sometimes post (rough) updates on this\njourney.\n\nI also enjoy reading about game design theory and practice. Here's a collection\nof my favorite [game design books and resources](/notes/gamedesign-resources).\n\n## Programming\n\nWhen it comes to programming, I'm a master of none. Tinkering with code has been\na big part of my life for as long as I remember and it still brings me joy and\nmakes time pass faster.\n\nWhether it's making design prototypes with JavaScript at work, making games with\nGodot or Unity, writing shell scripts for my\n[Linux desktop](https://github.com/kkga/dotfiles) or making little CLI apps with\nGo, I love it all and always try to learn more.

The goal is to add gameplay variety where the player can tweak a bunch of\nvariables at certain points in a single run and get different results.\n\ni've already implemented the bare functionality for this, so next step would be\nintegrating it into gameplay by creatign a bunch of initial traits and figuring\nout at which point during a game run the player should choose the next trait.\n"},{"slug":"weapon-system","title":"Weapon system","body":"\nRefactoring day.

This resource is then\npassed to the main `Weapon` class which handles all the setup internally from\nresource’s variables.\n\nI’m done with the main parts of this already, but I still need to add ability to\ncreate projectile-based weapons, since currently all player weapons are\nbasically instant hitscans.

Given the\nvisual nature of CSS Grid, we felt that Webflow is the perfect medium to create\na fully visual way of creating grid layouts by utilizing direct on-canvas\nmanipulation.\n\nTogether with the team I've worked on exploring various ways to interact with a\ngrid on canvas. After months of iterations and tests, we came up with a powerful\nand simple solution that fully utilizes Webflow's visual nature for creating\ngrid layouts.\n\n<ProjectLink url=\"https://www.webflow.com/grid\" title=\"Product overview on Webflow\" />\n\n<Grid breakout>\n  <Figure caption=\"Overview of grid's main features\">\n    <Video src=\"/img/about/webflow-grid.mp4\" />\n  </Figure>\n</Grid>\n\n<Figure caption=\"Grid playground built in Webflow for feature release\" >\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-grid-playground.gif\" />\n</Figure>\n\nShortly after the initial release, we've added a fully visual support for\nworking with\n[Grid template areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Grid_Template_Areas),\nmaking it even easier to create and adjust grid layouts using direct on-canvas\nmanipulation.\n\n<Figure caption=\"Defining grid areas on canvas\">\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-grid-areas-1.gif\" />\n</Figure>\n<Figure caption=\"Dragging elements into grid areas\">\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-grid-areas-2.gif\" />\n</Figure>\n<Figure caption=\"Adjusting areas for smaller screens\">\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-grid-areas-3.gif\" />\n</Figure>\n\n---\n\n## Symbol overrides\n\nWebflow’s symbols let authors reuse a common layout across multiple pages -- for\nexample, a navigation bar, a footer, or a sign up form.\n\nUp until now, there was no way of using the same symbol with different content.\nThis limitation greatly decreased the range of cases where symbols can be used.\n\nI've worked on adding dynamic content overrides to symbols, which would let\nauthors define text, images, videos or links that are editable on different\nsymbol instances.\n\nWith this feature, authors can utilize symbols for a much wider range of\nuse-cases by turning various recurring layouts into symbols, each with its own\ncontent. As authors restructure the layout of that symbol, each instance will\npreserve its unique content.\n\n<ProjectLink\n  url=\"https://webflow.com/blog/content-overrides-for-symbols\"\n  title=\"Feature overview on Webflow blog\" />\n\n<Figure caption=\"Defining overrides inside a symbol\">\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-symbols-1.gif\" />\n</Figure>\n<Figure caption=\"Overriding content on a symbol instance\">\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-symbols-2.gif\" />\n</Figure>\n<Figure caption=\"Adjusting layout across multiple symbols\">\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-symbols-3.gif\" />\n</Figure>\n\n---\n\n## Interactions and animations\n\nWhen I started working on \"Interactions 2.0\", Webflow already had simple tools\nto add interactions and animations to elements on a page. However, we wanted a\nmore poweful and flexible solution that would let authors create rich, sequenced\nanimations using a visual timeline. Another goal was to let authors create\nanimations and interactions based on various dynamic inputs, like scroll\nposition or mouse movement.\n\nWhile exploring different approaches for a visual interface, I came up with the\nidea of a simplified vertical timeline that would let authors stack various\n\"actions\" along an axis. The vertical axis can represent either time or a\ndynamic value from user's input, like mouse position or scroll progress.\n\nThis interface metaphor proved to strike a perfect balance between a full-blown\ntimeline usually found in professional animation software and a simple,\nuncomplicated way to create rich animations and interactions.\n\n<ProjectLink\n  url=\"https://webflow.com/interactions-animations\"\n  title=\"Product overview on Webflow\" />\n\n<ProjectLink\n  url=\"https://webflow.com/ix2\"\n  title=\"Launch page that fully utilizes the feature\" />\n\n<Grid breakout>\n  <Figure caption=\"Examples of timed and dynamic animations triggered by various events\">\n    <Grid className=\"grid-cols-4\">\n      <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-ui-click-actions.jpg\" />\n      <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-ui-hover-actions.jpg\" />\n      <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-ui-mouse-actions.jpg\" />\n      <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-ui-scroll-actions.jpg\" />\n    </Grid>\n  </Figure>\n</Grid>\n\n<Figure caption=\"Overview of creating various animations\" >\n  <Video src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix.mp4\" />\n</Figure>\n<Figure caption=\"Adjusting the easing curve on an intro animation\" >\n  <Video src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-easing.mp4\" />\n</Figure>\n\n### In the wild\n\nHere are various animations and interactions created using this feature in\nWebflow.\n\n<Grid className=\"grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-cubes.gif\" />\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-parallax.gif\" />\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-demo.gif\" />\n  <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-ix-hover.gif\" />\n</Grid>\n\n---\n\n## Flexbox\n\nFlexbox was one of the first projects I've worked on at Webflow.\n\nThe challenge was to translate a powerful\n[CSS layout mechanism](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)\ninto a simple and intuitive visual interface that allows designers to create\nexpressive, responsive layouts on the web.\n\nThis feature was released in early days of Webflow, when the design team was\njust 2 people. In addition to product design work, I've also built a\n[Flexbox learning game](https://flexboxgame.com) in Webflow and an educational\n[marketing website](https://flexbox.webflow.com) for feature release.\n\nFlexbox remains one of the most used layout tools in Webflow. Since the initial\nrelease in 2016, I've worked on several updates that improve and streamline the\ninterface.\n\n<ProjectLink\n  url=\"https://flexbox.webflow.com\"\n  title=\"Educational site I built for feature release\" />\n<ProjectLink\n  url=\"https://www.flexboxgame.com/\"\n  title=\"Flexbox learning game I built in Webflow\" />\n\n<Grid breakout>\n  <Figure caption=\"Flexbox in action\">\n    <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-flexbox.gif\" />\n  </Figure>\n</Grid>\n\n<Grid className=\"grid-cols-2\">\n  <Figure caption=\"First iteration of Flexbox controls\" >\n    <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-flexbox.webp\" />\n  </Figure>\n  <Figure caption=\"Educational marketing website\" >\n    <Img src=\"/img/about/webflow-flexbox-site.webp\" />\n  </Figure>\n</Grid>\n"}]
