My name is Gadzhi. Born in [Dagestan](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan),
living in ~Moscow~ Ä°stanbul. Designing software is what I do for work and joy.

### Work

[Retool](https://retool.com) <small>--- design engineer,
2021&ndash;</small><br/> A tool for building internal tools. I'm working on
[Workflows](https://retool.com/products/workflows/).

[Webflow](https://webflow.com) <small>--- product designer,
2015&ndash;2021</small>
<br/>A platform that makes producing for web more approachable. Mostly focused
on figuring out how to create the right visual tools for designers.
[See my work at Webflow](/work/webflow).

[Stampsy](https://stampsy.com) <small>--- designer/engineer,
2012&ndash;2014</small><br/>A small social platform for creating visual stories.
I designed the product and built a modular CSS architecture behind it.
[See my work at Stampsy](/work/stampsy).

### Game design

I'm interested in video game design and development. It's a fun area that is
hard to master and I try to spend my free time tinkering with various personal
projects. I have a [dlog](/dlog) where I sometimes post (rough) updates on this
journey.

I also enjoy reading about game design theory and practice. Here's a collection
of my favorite [books and resources](/notes/gamedesign-resources.md).

### Programming

When it comes to programming, I'm a master of none. Tinkering with code has been
a big part of my life for as long as I remember and it still brings me joy and
makes time pass faster.

Whether it's making design prototypes with JavaScript at work, making games with
Godot or Unity, writing shell scripts for my
[Linux desktop](https://github.com/kkga/dotfiles) or making little CLI programs
with Go, I love it all and always try to learn more. I put occasionally useful
things on [my GitHub](https://github.com/kkga).

### Photos

I used to take a lot of photos with my favorite camera, a Leica M6 paired with
Summicron 35mm and 50mm lenses. My old photographs can be found on my
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gadzhi/albums) page.

These days, I don't take as many photos but still enjoy the occasional photo
walk with a Fujifilm X100V. I'm experimenting with a simple photo gallery here:

### This website

...is fairly simple. Written mostly in markdown and built with
[Ter](https://ter.kkga.me) --- a small wiki-style site generator that I made.
