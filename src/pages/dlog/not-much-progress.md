not much progress today as i didn't really get a chance to focus.

i've fixed some issues in the Agent's class state machine (i.e. enemies), but
still struggling to get all the state transitions to work properly. thinking i'm
gonna leave it as if for since they're not the top prio at the moment and get
back later when i'll need to work on the navigation and pathfinding.
