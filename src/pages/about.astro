    ## Work

    #### Retool (2021--)

    I'm currently working as a design engineer at [Retool](https://retool.com).

    #### Webflow (2015--2021)

    Worked at [Webflow](https://webflow.com) -- a platform that makes producing for
    web more approachable. Mostly focused on figuring out how to create the right
    visual tools for designers.<br/>

    #### Stampsy (2012--2014)

    Worked as a designer (and partly as a front-end engineer) at
    [Stampsy](https://stampsy.com) -- a small web platform for creating and
    discovering visual stories. I designed the product and built a modular CSS
    architecture behind it.<br/> **[Learn more about my work Stampsy →](/stampsy)**

    ## Game design

    Recently I became interested in video game design and development. It's a fun
    area that is hard to master and I try to spend my free time tinkering with
    various personal projects. I have a [dlog](/tags/dlog) where I sometimes post
    (very rough) updates on this journey.

    I also enjoy reading about game design theory and practice. Here's a collection
    of my favorite [game design books and resources](/notes/gamedesign-resources).

    ## Programming

    When it comes to programming, I'm a master of none. Tinkering with code has been
    a big part of my life for as long as I remember and it still brings me joy and
    makes time pass faster.

    Whether it's making design prototypes with JavaScript at work, making games with
    Godot or Unity, writing shell scripts for my
    [Linux desktop](https://github.com/kkga/dotfiles) or making little CLI apps with
    Go, I love it all and always try to learn more. I put occasionally useful things
    on [my GitHub](https://github.com/kkga).

    ### This website

    ...is fairly simple. Written mostly in markdown, generated by
    [Astro](https://astro.build/) (which lets me use a few React components)
    and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

    The typefaces are set in
    [MD Nichrome](https://www.mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-nichrome) and
    [MD IO](https://www.mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-io).

    Source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/kkga/kkga). You can
    freely clone it and use as a base for your own website.
