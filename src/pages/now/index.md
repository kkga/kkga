This is a ["/now"](https://nownownow.com/about) page. You should have one too.

## Tinkering with hardware

I've been slowly trying out various weird custom keyboards over the past year or
so. I'm currently planning to build a couple of barebones minimalistic 34-key
boards, as that's the number of keys that I'm using for my layout at the moment.

## Tinkering with software

Still enjoying Go and maintaining a couple of CLI programs I wrote with it, but
I've been interested in Clojure for a while and want to learn more about it.

## Playing

Deathloop. It's one of the best games I've ever played. Also waiting for Elden
Ring to come out in February.

## Reading

Mostly technical/programming books.
