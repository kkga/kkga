One of my favorite websites is [usesthis.com](https://usesthis.com/). I always
liked reading about the tools people use to get through their day to day.

This page outlines a few details around my own setup.

### Hardware

- Custom PC with Ryzen 3600 cpu
- MacBook Air M1
- iPad Pro 11
- Logitech MX Ergo trackball mouse
- [Corne-ish Zen][corneish] keyboard

#### Note on keyboards

I’m experimenting with keyboards and layouts a lot lately.

I’ve had a bunch of various keyboards over the last couple years, but I prefer the low-profile Choc switches by Kailh (the Purpz version).

My layout config has been slimming down in size since I started experimenting. I’m currently using a 34 keys layout and this picture gives an idea of how it works.

The current layout configuration for Corne-ish Zen can be found [here](https://github.com/kkga/zmk-config-Corne-ish-Zen).

### Software

I use macOS for work, while Linux is my preferred OS for personal computering needs.
Even though I’ve been a macOS user for 15+ years, I like Linux more these days.

My Linux setup is barebones: I don’t use a full-fledged desktop environment. A tiling window manager, a fast terminal and a browser — that’s all I need.

I do all text editing and coding in Kakoune, which is my favorite piece of software.

Here's a list of essential pieces:

- Arch Linux on laptop
- Void Linux on desktop
- Sway (window manager)
- Foot (terminal)
- Kakoune (text editor)

My desktop configuration lives in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kkga/config).
