One of my favorite websites is [usesthis.com](https://usesthis.com/). I always
liked reading about the tools people use to get through their day to day.

This page outlines some details around my own setup.

- I use 2 operating systems: macOS and Linux;
- macOS is mostly used for work, while Linux is my preferred OS for personal
  computering needs;
- even though Iâ€™ve been a macOS user for 15+ years, I like Linux more,
  especially lately.

### Hardware

- Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 9
- Custom PC with Ryzen 3600 cpu
- MacBook Air M1
- iPad Pro 11
- Logitech MX Ergo trackball mouse

### Software

- Arch Linux on laptop
- Void Linux on desktop
- Sway (window manager)
- Foot (terminal)
- Kakoune (text editor)
