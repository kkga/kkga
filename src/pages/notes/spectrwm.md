## what I like

- overall “lightweight-ness” and simplicity;
- the master/stack model works pretty much like
  [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/), which is perfect;
- great set of options, so achieving the same workflow I had on dwm is easy;
- plain text configuration file;
- single tag-set across multiple monitors;

## don’t like

- the built-in bar is great, but lacks a system tray;
