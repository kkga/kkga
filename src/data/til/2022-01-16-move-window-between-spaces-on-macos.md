title: Move window between spaces on macOS

I always use multiple spaces on macOS and the typical way to move windows
between spaces always felt annoying:

- open Mission Control;
- grab the needed window on the current space and drag it to another space;
- open the new space.

Given that I mostly use keyboard shortcuts for quick switching between spaces
(which can be configured in
`System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Mission Control` ), this whole
multi-step operation involving several animations is way too slow.

There's a better way:

- without opening Mission Control, grab and hold the window on the current
  space;
- use the keyboard shortcut (described above) to switch to a different space --
  the window will follow.

There are tools that let you do this without involving a mouse: like [yabai] or
[amethyst], but I stopped using them since macOS is hard to operate without a
mouse in the first place, even when running the aforementioned tools.
