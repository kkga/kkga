Hello, I'm Gadzhi. Currently, I work at [Retool](https://retool.com) as a design
engineer. Before that, I was an early designer at
[Webflow](https://webflow.com). You can learn more [about me](about.md) and
[my work](work.md).

In my free time, I enjoy working on small personal [projects](projects),
learning new things, and playing challenging video games (particularly those by
From Software).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@kkga_) or reach out via email
at me[at]kkga.me.
