title: First dlog note

this is an experiment. i saw a similar log on the web and it felt like a great
idea, so i'm gonna start one too. just planning to dump out my brain here by the
end of day, if i managed to work on something that day.

so... happy with the result of work today. managed to finally figure out how to
implement the godot steering AI framework for my specific use-case. not fully
working yet, but that just needs execution and polish.

next up going to refactor all the AI movement and state machine code to use the
new steering behavior, that should be now much easier to tweak and grow upon.
