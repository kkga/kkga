import Video from "@/components/Video.astro";
import tdDemo from "../img/dlog/td-demo.mp4";

quick demo of the current state of the game.

i've been working on improving various map interactions last few days:

- placing/removing towers
- highlighting range of towers
- showing info in the bottom right corner when hovering over towers
- checking that spawners still have a path before letting player to choose a
  cell on the map
