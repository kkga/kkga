# Ter

Ter is a tiny wiki engine with Zettelkasten flavor.

Ter takes a folder of markdown files and replicates its structure into a static
site with automatically indexed directories, backlinks and breadcrumbs.

I worked on Ter to get familiar with [Deno](https://deno.land), which is fun,
and to get a bit less terrible at TypeScript.
