Being a [Vim user](/notes/vim), I've been experimenting with
[Kakoune](https://kakoune.org) for the past year and it became my go-to program
for doing any sorts of text- or code-editing. It's a delightful piece of
software that improves on many Vim concepts. I could never describe it better
than
[Screwtape did](https://gist.github.com/Screwtapello/563628f777f0fc9f4d5fb681058d63ec).

Here's a list of various small (and mostly useless) plugins I've created for
Kakoune.
