A simple app for jotting things down.

It lives in a browser tab, quick to switch to and quick to navigate with a
keyboard. The content is stored in your browser, so you can close the tab and
come back to it later.

<ul class="aside">
  <li>
    <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://jotdown.page">
      jotdown.page
