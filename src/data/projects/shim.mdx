Shim is a collection of copy-paste React components, meticulously styled and ready to go.<br />
The project includes a variety of components based on [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) with multiple sizing scales and visual variants, a theming system and a handy CLI for adding components to your project.
