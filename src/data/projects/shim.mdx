Shim is a collection of copy-paste React components, meticulously styled and
ready to go.<br /> The project includes a variety of components based on
[React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) with
multiple sizing scales and visual variants, a theming system and a handy CLI for
adding components to your project.
