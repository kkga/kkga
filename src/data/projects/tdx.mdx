CLI todo manager for [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) files,
written in Go.

iCalendar-compatibility means it can serve as a simple companion to any
CalDAV-enabled todo program, such as iOS Reminders.

- add todos, with automatic date and priority parsing
- list todos, sorted/filtered by various fields and organized by hashtags parsed
  from text
- complete todos
- edit todos in a `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` program
- delete todos
- purge completed/cancelled todos
