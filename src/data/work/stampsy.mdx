Stampsy is a social platform for sharing and discovering visual stories.

I worked with the team during 2012&ndash;2014 and it was the first start-up
company I joined full-time after doing mostly freelance work.

## Stampsy Web

My work ranged from full-cycle product and user interface design to front-end
engineering and CSS styling.

Together with the team, I've planned the initial scope of the product and its
features, designed the web application and prototyped a lot of the Stampsy
Editor interactions in Framer.js (when it was just a small open-source library).

Later on I moved to building a responsive CSS architecture for the app and
helped the front-end team by transforming the design system into reusable and
styled React components.

## Stampsy iPad app

In 2012, before becoming a web platform, Stampsy was an experimental iPad app
for creating stories with a simple design editor. I designed and prototyped a
lot of its touch-based interactions with different tools and codez.
