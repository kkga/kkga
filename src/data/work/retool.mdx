I joined Retool in 2021 to help build a completely new product — Retool
Workflows. The team was just 2 people — me and a full-stack engineer. I drove
product and interaction design, iterated on the core flow primitives (API
blocks, logic, control flow, etc) and built most of the final Workflows UI in
React.

<ul class="aside">
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://retool.com/workflows">
      retool.com/workflows
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

Since then the team has grown significantly and Workflows has become a key part
of the Retool platform. The point was always the same: move quickly, get honest
feedback, and build automations engineers actually want to use.

Early on I prototyped several control-flow and transformer blocks in the
[Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) because its canvas/graph APIs made
it fast to experiment with runtime behavior.
