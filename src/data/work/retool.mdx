## Retool Agents

Retool Agents are autonomous AI “workers” you build in Retool that use LLM
reasoning to take actions — they call your APIs/queries/workflows, make
decisions (or ask humans), and execute tasks end-to-end.

I led the design of the product from early exploration to launch, working
closely with engineers and product managers to define the user flows,
interaction models, and visual design.

## IDE explorations

I've worked on various prototypes exploring different IDE concepts for building
and debugging Retool apps. Some of these experiments have influenced the final
product, while others remain as explorations.

### Visualizing logic

Retool apps can get complex quickly with many interconnected components and
stateful logic spread across multiple layers. In an effort to help users
understand and debug their apps, I worked on a prototype for visualizing data
and control flow in a Retool app. The tree shows a graph of relationships
between queries, variables and components on the canvas, allowing users to trace
how data moves through the app.

The goal was to have a lightweight layer of visual feedback that is "always
there" and helps users reason about app behavior as they build.

## Retool Workflows

I joined Retool in 2021 to help build a completely new product — Retool
Workflows. The team was just 2 people — me and a full-stack engineer. I drove
product and interaction design, iterated on the core flow primitives (API
blocks, logic, control flow, etc) and built most of the final Workflows UI in
React.

      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</aside>

Since then the team has grown significantly and Workflows has become a key part
of the Retool platform. The point was always the same: move quickly, get honest
feedback, and build automations engineers actually want to use.

Early on I prototyped several control-flow and transformer blocks in the
[Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) because its canvas/graph APIs made
it fast to experiment with runtime behavior.
