[Webflow](https://webflow.com) is a "no-code" web platform. I joined the team as
one of the first two designers in 2015. Over the next six years, I have
contributed to the development of numerous new features and enhancements for the
[Webflow Designer](https://webflow.com/designer). My work has included designing
layout systems and creating animation and interaction tooling, among other
tasks.

This portfolio showcases some of the projects I have worked on during these
years. Note that some of my most recent and impactful work is still unreleased
and cannot be shown at this time.

## Grid layout with direct manipulation

</a>

[CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) is
a powerful new layout mechanism that has transformed the way web developers
create layouts. The challenge was to make it easier to use in Webflow by
abstracting some of the complexity and allowing users to create grid layouts
visually, using direct on-canvas manipulation.

Unlike previous tools in Webflow, which required most style properties to be
adjusted via the inspector panel, we wanted the Grid to be different. Given the
visual nature of CSS Grid, we felt that Webflow was the ideal platform for
creating grid layouts in a fully visual way, using direct on-canvas
manipulation.

</figure>

Working with the team, I explored various ways to interact with a grid on the
canvas. After months of iteration and testing, we developed a powerful and
simple solution that fully leverages Webflow's visual nature for creating grid
layouts.

<figure class="feature">
  <Video
    controls={true}
    autoplay={false}
    src={gridVideo}
    poster={gridVideoPoster.src}
  />
  <figcaption>Overview of grid's main features</figcaption>
</figure>

Shortly after the initial release, we added support for working with
[Grid template areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Grid_Template_Areas),
which made it even easier to create and adjust grid layouts using direct
on-canvas manipulation.

<div class="feature">
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem title="Defining areas">
      <Video src={gridAreas1} controls />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem title="Positioning items">
      <Video src={gridAreas2} controls />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem title="Adjusting for mobile">
      <Video src={gridAreas3} controls />
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</div>

## Interactions and animations

</a>

When I started working on "Interactions 2.0", Webflow already had basic tools
for adding interactions and animations to elements on a page. However, we wanted
a more powerful and flexible solution that would allow authors to create rich,
sequenced animations using a visual timeline. Additionally, we wanted to give
authors the ability to create animations and interactions based on various
dynamic inputs, such as scroll position or mouse movement.

<figure>
  <Video src={ixReel} />
  <figcaption>Interactions 2.0</figcaption>
</figure>

While exploring different approaches for a visual interface, I came up with the
idea of a simplified vertical timeline that would allow authors to stack various
"actions" along an axis. The vertical axis can represent either time or a
dynamic value from user input, such as mouse position or scroll progress.

<Image src={ixMock} alt="Interactions UI" />

This interface metaphor proved to be a good balance between the full-blown
timelines found in professional animation software and a simple yet flexible way
to create rich animations and interactions.

## Components and instance overrides

<a
  target="_blank"
  class="m-0 place-self-center text-base"
  href="https://webflow.com/blog/content-overrides-for-symbols"
>
  webflow.com/blog/content-overrides-for-symbols
</a>

In the past, Webflow had a feature called "Symbols" which allowed users to reuse
an element across multiple pages. For example, a user could create a Symbol for
a navigation bar, footer, or sign-up form and reuse it on multiple pages.
However, there was no way to use the same Symbol with different content. This
limitation greatly reduced the range of situations in which Symbols could be
used.

To address this limitation, I worked on evolving Symbols into Components by
adding the ability to override content parameters. This allowed authors to
define text, images, links, and other properties that could be edited on
individual Component instances.

This update significantly expanded the range of situations in which Components
could be used. Authors could turn various recurring layouts into Components and
reuse them across their project, applying individual content overrides as
needed. Any structural or stylistic changes made to the Components would be
reflected in all instances, while the content overrides would be retained.

<div class="feature">
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem title="Defining overrides">
      <img src={symbols1.src} />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem title="Overriding content">
      <img src={symbols2.src} />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem title="Adjusting all instances">
      <img src={symbols3.src} />
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

## Flexbox

<div class="mt-0 flex justify-center gap-4">
  <a target="_blank" class="text-base" href="https://flexbox.webflow.com">
    flexbox.webflow.com
  </a>
  <a target="_blank" class="text-base" href="https://www.flexboxgame.com">
    flexboxgame.com
  </a>
</div>

This was one of my first projects after joining the team. The challenge was to
translate a powerful CSS layout mechanism into a simple and intuitive visual
interface that allowed designers to create expressive, responsive layouts on the
web.

This feature was released in the early days of Webflow, when the design team was
just two people. In addition to my product design work, I also built a Flexbox
learning game in Webflow and an educational marketing website for feature
release.

Flexbox has proven to be a very useful addition to Webflow Designer. Since its
initial release in 2016, I have worked on several updates that improve and
streamline the interface.
